<h1>The Best Movies According to Antoneta</h1>
<h2>My top three movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Passion of Christ</h3>
<p>I like this movie as it is the most beautiful and visual presentation of the sufferings of Jesus for the sins of the world</p>
<h3>The Croods</h3>
<p>This is a fun movie of presumably prehistoric times, it is just fun</p>
<h3>The trip</h3>
<p>In this movie there are many lessons related to virtues and values, many lessons to learn there</p>
